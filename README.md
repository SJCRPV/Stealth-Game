# Stealth-Game
This project was made for the Jogos e Simulação (In English: Games and Simulation).
The focus was not in designing a good game by any means, it was instead focused on the more technical aspects so we could learn the complexity of a game engine. The requisites were the following:
* A procedurally generated map
* Dynamic lighting
* Physics
* Inspector camera
* Bump mapping
* Shadows
* Animated characters
* Particle effects
